## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

This project was a great learning experience! Here are some key takeaways:

- **Working with Bootstrap for the first time:** I used Bootstrap to create a responsive layout more easily than writing all the CSS from scratch. It sped up the process and helped me understand responsive design principles better.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Building the layout for mobile devices first made the design process smoother. It helped me focus on the essential content and then progressively enhance it for larger screens.
- **Understanding Media Queries:** I gained a much better understanding of how media queries work and how to use them to adapt the layout for different screen sizes. I was able to put into practice concepts I'd been wanting to try for a while.


### Continued development

I want to continue practicing with:

-  More complex Bootstrap layouts.
-  Advanced CSS techniques for responsive design.
-  Optimizing images for different screen sizes and resolutions.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - The official Bootstrap documentation was invaluable for understanding how to use the framework's components and utilities.
- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me to better understand Flexbox and how to use it effectively for layout.
- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin's videos on CSS are always helpful to understand best practices.
